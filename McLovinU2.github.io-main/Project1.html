                <p class="lead mb-5">A generative adversary network (GAN) consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminatory model. The discriminatory model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN). What makes this an adversary network is that the generator is going to produce images (that start out random) and the discriminatory model is going to give a Boolean return, if the image is real or not. The weights of the GAN are adjusted based on the results the discriminatory model gives. See image 1 for a visual representation of a GAN model. </p>

                        <p class="lead mb-5">
                            For this project I started by making a AI algorithm that could generate handwritten numbers. This was done by training the model on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70.000 handwritten number images.
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead mb-5"> I wanted to compare the models' optimization performance, for this I compared multiple optimizers with eachother. Which showed that Adam was the best optimizer, see image 2.</p>

                        <h2>Generating human faces</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">To increase the difficulty of the AI algorithm. I wanted to generate colour images, for this is used the CelebA database. This database consists of 202,599 images. It took my laptop four hours to train on 4 epochs. With a supercomputer the results would be better. The results where 18 generated faces, see image 4. </p>
